==  When executing the !TheBeast java class instead of calling {{{thebeast}}} I get a "Exception in thread "main" java.lang.!UnsatisfiedLinkError: no lpsolve55j in java.library.path" message ==

thebeast uses the free ILP solver lp_solve for MAP inference. This is C-code which java calls via a JNI interface. In order to call lp_solve two things are needed: the actual C library (lpsolve55 -- with some prefix and file extension depending on OS type) and the JNI implementation (lpsolve55j again with different extension and prefix) that calls the C-library and communicates with java. Both files for different platforms are in {{{thebeast/bin}}}.

If you want to use thebeast lpsolve55 must be in your OS library path and lpsolve55j must be in your java.library.path. If the beast is stored the directory  {{{THEBEAST}}} than you would need to call
{{{
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$THEBEAST/bin
}}}
before executing the TheBeast java class. This ensures that lpsolve55 is in the system loader path. To make sure the JVM finds the JNI lib you can add {{{-Djava.libary.path $THEBEAST/bin}}} as argument to the java interpreter.
